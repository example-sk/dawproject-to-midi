# DAWproject to Midi file converter

## Why does this project exist?
BitWig midi exporter doesn't support automations. That's sad. Once BitWig fixes this issue, this project is obsolete and will be deleted immediately (kinda).

## How to use it?
In BitWig, click on File -> Export DAWproject. Then visit [https://www.example.sk/dawproject-to-midi/](https://www.example.sk/dawproject-to-midi/) and select the new DAWproject file. Your browser will download a new Midi file.
